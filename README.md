# Eagler Common Runtime

Shared runtime infrastructure for Eagler Touhou ports.

License: MIT.

This directory is the single source of truth for code that is independent of a
specific Touhou title.  Game repositories keep adapters for title-owned state
and may keep thin compatibility headers during migration, but shared algorithms
must not be forked back into per-title implementations.

## Ownership boundary

Good common-library candidates:

- netplay protocol/session/core algorithms;
- transport and browser networking;
- rollback journals and fixed-pool snapshot primitives;
- generic input scheduling/prediction/repair;
- fixed-step/browser lifecycle helpers;
- diagnostics and performance-test primitives.

Keep title-specific:

- rollback state inventory and object layout;
- canonical hashes of title-owned state;
- Bullet/Enemy/ECL/Stage/Bomb ownership rules;
- native Replay format semantics;
- title-specific gameplay lifecycle adapters.

The rule is: **share algorithms and infrastructure, not object layouts**.

## Migration policy

Migration is intentionally incremental.  Extract exact duplicates first, prove
both games still pass their existing gates, then converge near-duplicates.  Do
not combine common-library extraction with gameplay-state or protocol changes in
the same step.

Current first slice:

- `NetplaySession`
- `WebSocketTransport`

Both were byte-identical in TH06 and TH07 before extraction.

Future intended slices include `NetplayProtocol`, `NetplayCore`,
`RollbackJournal`, browser peer transport, rollback primitives and the shared
performance testkit once their title-facing seams are explicit.

## Convergence order

Use this order unless new evidence proves a dependency requires otherwise:

1. exact duplicates: `NetplaySession`, `WebSocketTransport`;
2. near-identical wire/core code: `NetplayProtocol`, `NetplayCore`;
3. generic storage: `RollbackJournal` plus fixed-pool/sparse snapshot helpers;
4. browser transport: `BrowserPeerTransport`, input repair and health logic;
5. generic input semantics and rollback driver helpers;
6. performance testkit and diagnostics;
7. only then consider broader platform/presentation helpers.

Every step must leave TH06 and TH07 buildable and testable independently. A
consumer may advance to a newer common implementation only after its own
title-specific rollback/canonical gates pass. Do not make a common refactor and
a gameplay-state change in the same acceptance step.

## Version/authority rule

`eagler-common` is the implementation authority. Per-game files with the same
old names may exist only as forwarding/compatibility shims while migration is in
progress. They must not contain a second implementation.

The canonical published layout uses a pinned `third_party/eagler-common` Git
submodule in each game repository, pointing at `YomotsuHisami/eagler-common`.
The workspace sibling remains a development fallback and an explicit
`EAGLER_COMMON_ROOT` override remains available for controlled experiments.

Consumers link the CMake component target `eagler::netplay_base`. In the first
slice this is intentionally an INTERFACE component: `NetplaySession` still
uses the consumer-owned `<netplay/NetplayProtocol.hpp>`, so the common sources
must compile in the consumer target's include/toolchain context. Moving
`NetplayProtocol` into common is the next convergence slice; do not duplicate
the protocol here merely to make the first slice appear self-contained.

Do not push a consumer commit that requires the common library until the common
repository/revision it names is available remotely. CI/release builds must pin
an exact common commit; they must never fetch an unpinned branch head.

Until a stable release policy is declared, the dependency version is the exact
Git commit recorded by the consumer submodule. Breaking shared-runtime changes
must be validated against every consumer before advancing those gitlinks.

## Standalone validation

`eagler-common` has a minimal consumer fixture so the repository can validate
its current component contract without checking out a Touhou game repository:

```text
cmake -S . -B build -DEAGLER_COMMON_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The TH06/TH07 workspace integration contract remains a separate gate because
it validates real consumer shims, CMake wiring and full Web builds.
